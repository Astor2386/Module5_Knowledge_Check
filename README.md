# Bootstrap Knowledge Check Web App

## Project Overview.
Welcome to my Bootstrap Knowledge Check project! This is a hands-on web app I built using Bootstrap 5.3.0.. 
It’s a responsive site with a navigation bar, registration form, user data table, and cool image/buttons section—all styled with Bootstrap and validated using basic HTML5.
Perfect for practicing web design basics and meeting my class assignment requirements.

## What You’ll Find
- **Navigation**: A clean, collapsible navbar with links to Home, About, and easy navigating on any device.
- **Registration Form**: A form where you can enter First Name, Last Name, Email, Password, and agree to terms. It uses simple HTML5 validation to ensure all fields are filled out (browser will pop up messages like “Please fill out this field”).
- **User Data Table**: A pre-populated table showing sample user info, styled with Bootstrap’s striped and hover effects.
- **Images & Buttons**: A full-width image, a circular profile pic, and buttons—one always visible, one hidden on small screens for responsiveness.

## Getting Started
No fancy setup needed—just follow these steps:

1. **Grab the Files**:
   - Download or clone the `index.html` file to your computer.

2. **Launch It**:
   - Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) by double-clicking it, or use a live server in VS Code for a smoother preview. (live server recommended)

3. **Play Around**:
   - Try resizing the window to see how it responds on mobile, tablet, or desktop.
   - Fill out the form (or leave it blank) to test the validation popups.
   - Check out the navbar collapse on smaller screens.

## Requirements
- A recent web browser.
- An active internet connection (for Bootstrap CDN and Picsum image placeholders).

## How It’s Structured
- **index.html**: This single file holds all the magic—navbar, form, table, images, and buttons. No extra files needed!

## Tips for Testing
- Submit the form with empty fields to see the browser’s validation messages.
- Shrink your browser window to watch the navbar turn into a burger menu and the button disappear on small screens.
- Enjoy the responsive images scaling perfectly across devices. (random images will cylcle if page is refreshed, never the same old one!)

## Credits & Tools
